Hello everyone and welcome to this PCBS project !

## Description of the project

The goal of this project is to program a random dot motion (RDM) task which is typically used in perceptual decision making.
This task is quite simple : there is a certain amount of dots on the screen that are moving randomly, and some of them (for example 25%) are moving towards the left or the right. The aim of the participant is to decide in which direction te dots are moving. 
The percentage of motion coherence (i.e. what proportion of dots are moving in the same direction) can vary and we would like to compute, for each participant, a psychometric curve showing the percentage of correct answers as a function of the motion coherence of the stimulus.
Eventually, it will be possible to determine the threshold of motion coherence above which someone is able to ditinguish a coherent motion.

N.B.: I do not have any specific article since this task is very famous. However, I found a [really interesting paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004269890900100X) comparing different RDM algorithms. A good start would be the "White Noise" algorithm since it is the oldest one, but it could be nice to compare different algorithms if there is enough time !
